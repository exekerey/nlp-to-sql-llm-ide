# BI-GPT: Corporate Database Agent (Natural Language â†’ SQL)

---

## Problem/Context

*   Executives want to ask BI questions in natural language (e.g., "profit for the last 2 days," "margin for the month," "average check," "inventory levels").
*   High dependency on BI analysts for even simple queries.
*   Slow response times and a long queue for the BI team.

---

## Goal

An agent that understands natural language (NL) queries, generates safe and accurate SQL, considers the business dictionary, and returns correct aggregates with explanations.

---

## Solution: SQL AI Studio

A web-based IDE that allows non-technical users to interact with corporate databases using natural language.

## Key Features

*   **Natural Language to SQL:** A chat interface to convert plain English into SQL queries.
*   **SQL Editor:** AI-generated SQL is displayed in an editor for review and editing.
*   **Data Table:** The results of the SQL query are displayed in a table.
*   **Database Connection:** Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
*   **IDE-like Experience:** A familiar and powerful interface for interacting with SQL databases.

## How it Works

1.  **Connect to Database:** The user provides their database credentials.
2.  **Ask a question:** The user types a question in plain English into the chat interface.
3.  **AI generates SQL:** The AI converts the question into an SQL query.
4.  **Review and edit:** The user can review and edit the generated SQL query in the editor.
5.  **Execute and View results:** The user executes the query, and the results are displayed in a table.
